# tic-tac-toe

Welcome to my simple Tic-Tac-Toe game. The rules are exactly like those in standard Tic-Tac-Toe. It is, however, important to remember that this game only supports two players playing at once.

In order to run this game, copy and paste the code into a Python interpreter. After that, begin playing the game as you normally would and enjoy!

Note that you need to run the code again in order to replay the game.
